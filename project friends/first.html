    <h1 class="display-4">FRIENDS FOREVER</h1>
    <p class=" para lead">Friendship means familiar and liking of each other's mind.

People who are friends talk to each other and spend time together. They trust one another and also help each other when they are in trouble or are hurt. Friends are people that can be looked up to and trusted. Usually friends have similar interests. A friend is one who admires a person's skill and helps or encourages them to make the right choices and do not get into any trouble at all.

The strength of the bond of friendship between two people can vary. If the bond is very strong, they are called best friends. This can usually be achieved by possessing the elements of friendship, by being kind, generous, loyal, honest and by having fun. With these qualities you can truly enjoy the bliss of friendship.

There are expectations, demands and complaints in friendship too. If friends don't match with your expectations, it does not mean you will break the friendship. It is all about understanding, realizing and helping whenever possible.

Friendship is both good and necessary. Man cannot live all alone. He is a social being. He needs someone to share his joys and sorrows. Generally, it is only people of similar age, character and background, mentality, etc., who can understand him and his problems. Friends are needed for support and for sharing.

There are many different types of friendships. Most people find friends at a very young age however it is harder for others. Many movies are based off of a group of friends. An example of a friendship would be that of Sierra, Olivia, Emma, Langli, and Mallory's in the movie Eight grade Whittier.

    <p>Sometimes, being with your best friend, is all the therapy you need.
      <br>
Keep the ones that heard you when you never said a word.
<br>
I would rather walk with a friend in the dark, than alone in the light.
<br>
A true friend accepts who you are, but also helps you become who you should be.
<br>
A friend knows the song in my heart and sings it to me when my memory fails.
<br>
Sometimes you meet a person and you just click—you’re comfortable with them, like you’ve known them your whole life, and you don’t have to pretend to be anyone or anything.
Because of you, I laugh a little harder, cry a little less, and smile a lot more.
